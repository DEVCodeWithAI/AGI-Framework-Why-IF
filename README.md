# AGI Framework Why & IF 🚀
Breaking the Limits of AI with Why & IF Thinking
🌎 The Next Evolution of AI

Traditional AI systems analyze, predict, and respond, but they lack true reasoning and self-learning.
AGI-Framework-Why-IF is designed to change that by building an AI that thinks, questions, and adapts like humans.

✅ Why? – The AI asks Why to deeply analyze the root cause of a problem.
✅ If? – It generates multiple "If" scenarios and selects the most optimal solution.
✅ Self-Learning – The system continuously refines its reasoning and decision-making without human intervention.
✅ Beyond LLMs – Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), this framework enables autonomous decision-making and real-world adaptability.

🚀 Our goal is to develop the first AGI that can reason, self-learn, and independently solve complex problems!
🔥 Why We Need Investment?

We have built the core framework, but to train and optimize it at scale, we need powerful hardware.
Cloud GPUs are not an option due to:

❌ High costs for 24/7 training
❌ Limited fine-tuning capabilities for long-term AGI development
❌ Data privacy and control concerns

To truly advance AGI, we require high-performance physical GPUs for dedicated, long-term model training.

🚀 We need a powerful GPU setup to continue development! 🚀
🔧 Required Hardware:

We are looking for sponsorship, investment, or support to acquire one of the following:

✔ NVIDIA RTX 5090 (Upcoming, Best Consumer-Level GPU)
✔ NVIDIA RTX A6000 Ada (High-End Workstation GPU)
✔ NVIDIA H100 PCIe (Cutting-Edge AI GPU for Research & AGI Training)

These GPUs will enable real-time fine-tuning, large-scale AGI simulations, and continuous self-learning cycles.
